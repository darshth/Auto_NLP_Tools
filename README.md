## Making AI simple, one tool at a time!

## Inspiration

When I asked a few people- What is the primary skill required for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or Data Science?
-A unanimous answer was â€œCODING SKILLS."

I do believe that coding gives you a certain edge over people who don't code. 
But, the most important skill required in any of the above 3 fields is- Understanding the Business Problem.

I have seen many professionals start coding in a single breath whenever they are asked to solve a problem.

-Neural Networks!
-30 Hidden Layers!
-4000 Neurons!
-Leaky Relu Function! And whatnot.

*Coding is art! But your business problem is your paintbrush! And your solution's performance isn't judged by your accuracy score, F-score, etc., but by the problem you solve, how well you solve it, and the extent to which it is helpful to the person who required your Solution.*

### So I decided to come-up with vault the code- to automate the redundant parts of code and make AI tools more accessible.
*Disclaimer- No Fancy Coding Involved.

## About

Vault the code is a collection of Python programs that I developed to reduce the redundant coding everywhere. 
We have been recycling and reusing for years now. It is time for us to recycle and reuse the codes that we are creating. It doesn't have a cool and sassy Front-End
(As of yet!). But these programs are easily accessible via Python 3+ installed on your computer and using your computer's Terminal.
