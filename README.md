# Vault The Code- Auto Python Tools
## Making NLP simple, one tool at a time!

## Inspiration

When I asked a few people- What is the main skill required for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or Data Science?
- A unanimous answer was 'CODING SKILLS'.

I do believe that coding gives you certain edge over people who don't code.
But, The most important skill required in any of the above 3 fields is- Understanding the Business Problem. 

I have seen a lot of professionals that start coding in a single breath, whenever they are asked to solve a problem.
- 30 Hidden Layer!
- 4000 Neurons!
- Leaky Relu Function!
And what not. 

## Coding is art! But your Business Problem is your Paintbrush! And your solution's performance isn't judged by your Accuracy Score, F-Score etc., but by the problem that you solve, how well you solve it and to the extent that it is useful to the person who required your Solution.

### So I decided to come-up with Vault The Code- to automate the redundant parts of code and make AI tools more accessible. 

## About

Vault the code is a collection of Python scripts that I developed to reduce the redundant coding everywhere.
We have been recycling and reusing since years now. It is the time for us to recycle and reuse the codes that we are creating.
It doesn't have a cool and sassy Front-End (As of yet!). But these scripts are easily accessible via Python 3+ installed on your computer and using your computer's Terminal function.

As of Febraury 11, 2020, Vault the code consists of an Auto-Cleaner for NLP text cleaning.
