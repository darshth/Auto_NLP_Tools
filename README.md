## Making AI simple, one tool at a time!

## Inspiration

When I asked a few people- What is the primary skill required for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or Data Science?
-A unanimous answer was “CODING SKILLS."

I do believe that coding gives you a certain edge over people who don't code. 
But, the most important skill required in any of the above 3 fields is- Understanding the Business Problem.

I have seen many professionals start coding in a single breath whenever they are asked to solve a problem.

-Neural Networks!
-30 Hidden Layers!
-4000 Neurons!
-Leaky Relu Function! And whatnot.

*Coding is art! But your business problem is your paintbrush! And your solution's performance isn't judged by your accuracy score, F-score, etc., but by the problem you solve, how well you solve it, and the extent to which it is helpful to the person who required your Solution.*

### So I decided to come-up with The Code Vault- To make AI, ML and Data Science accessible to anyone who has a computer and to remove the redundancies involved in coding.
*Disclaimer- No Fancy Coding Involved.

## About

The Code Vault is a collection of Python programs/apps that I developed to give the power of Data in the hands of people who know how to solve a problem but don’t have a formal background in coding. 

The Code Vault also reduces redundant coding everywhere. We have been recycling and reusing for years now. It is time for us to recycle and reuse the codes that we are creating. It doesn't have a cool and sassy Front-End (As of yet!). But these programs are easily accessible via Python 3+ installed on your computer and using your computer's Terminal.
